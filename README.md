# Surgery-Assistant-Robot
 A robot that will help surgeons make less mistakes during surgery by handling the surgical equipment instead of having human surgical assistants.

 The robot would have a camera whose visual input would be fed to the object detection algorithm. On recognising a tool the robots arm would move to pick up the tool and present it to the surgeon.

 Also when the surgeon is done with a particular tool he would present it to the robot and it would pick up the tool, rinse it and return it to the tool tray.

 ##Surgical tools object detection AI.

 The object detection AI was made using Jupyter notebooks written by Nicholas Renotte.
 The notebooks are a detailed walkthrough on how to create an object detection system that can detect virtually anything.

 ##Robot model

 The robot model was designed and tested in autodesk inventor.
